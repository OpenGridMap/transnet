# Transnet
The Transnet project consists of a set of Python and Matlab scripts for the automatic inference of high voltage power (transmission) grids based on crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Transnet yields two different models, a Common Information Model (CIM) model and a Matlab Simulink model. The latter can be used to perform load flow analysis. This manual guides you to the Transnet setup and gives several usage examples.

## PostgreSQL + PostGIS setup
Transnet relies on a local PostgreSQL + PostGIS installation, which is the host of power-relevant OSM data.
To install PostgreSQL + PostGIS open a terminal and execute the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install postgres postgis
```
Create a PostGIS-enabled database template:
```
sudo -u postgres createdb -U postgres -h localhost plpgsql transnet_template
```
